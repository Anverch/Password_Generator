# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This repository contains random password generator. I created prompt that asks the length of the password. If the length criteria are met, then we proceed to, gathering users input on what they would prefer to include in their random password. Each chosen character type appears at least once. When the random password is generated it displays on the text box of the page.
